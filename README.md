ARMSX3
======

Uses the latest RPCS3 upstream code (the recent ARM64 improvements included). 

iOS feasibility
---------------

An experimental, device-first iOS port now lives under
[`platforms/ios`](platforms/ios/README.md). The current small IPA tests the two
hard platform prerequisites, executable AArch64 JIT memory and Vulkan through
MoltenVK/Metal, before the full RPCS3 core is linked. It is not yet a PS3
gameplay build. See [`platforms/ios/TEST_STATUS.md`](platforms/ios/TEST_STATUS.md)
for verified gates and open work.


Android building
----------------

 arm64-v8a and armv8.2 is supported. You need the Android SDK with NDK r27 or newer,
CMake 3.30 or newer, and a JDK 17. Android Studio ships all of these.

Clone with submodules, then fetch the two third party checkouts that are not
submodules:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/ARMSX2/ARMSX3.git
    cd ARMSX3
    git clone https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/librashader 3rdparty/librashader
    git clone https://github.com/bylaws/libadrenotools android/armsx3-ui/app/src/main/cpp/libadrenotools

Build the core. This is the long part and produces an unstripped library of
around 1.3 GB:

    export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
    cmake -B build-android -G Ninja \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/<version>/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake \
      -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-31 \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
    cmake --build build-android --target rpcsx-android -j8

Strip it and put it where the app expects it:

    llvm-strip --strip-unneeded build-android/android/libarmsx3-core.so
    cp build-android/android/libarmsx3-core.so \
       android/armsx3-ui/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/

Then build the app:

    cd android/armsx3-ui
    export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
    ./gradlew :app:assembleRelease

The apk lands in app/build/outputs/apk/release/.

Note that the core library has to be rebuilt and copied again whenever anything
under rpcs3/ or android/src/ changes. Gradle does not build it for you.

The Discord Social SDK is proprietary and is not redistributed here. Get it from
Discord's developer portal and drop it in app/libs/ and
app/src/main/cpp/discord_sdk/ if you want that feature. The build skips it
otherwise.

Running it needs PS3 firmware, which is not included.
